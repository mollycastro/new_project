Learning [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is a great choice because [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) is:\n\n* Widely-adopted in the digital humanities and data science\n* Regarded as an easy-to-learn language\n* Flexible, having wide support for working with numerical and textual data \n* A skill desired by employers in academic, non-profit, and private sectors\n\nThe second most-popular language for digital humanities and data science work is [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r). We plan to create additional support for learning [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r) soon. If you are interested in helping develop open educational resources for [R](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#r), please reach out to Nathan Kelber (nathan.kelber@ithaka.org).\n\nThe skills you'll learn in *Python Basics* 1-5 are general-purpose [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) skills, applicable for any of the text analysis notebooks that you may explore later. They are also widely applicable to many other kinds of tasks in [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) beyond text analysis.\n\n**Making Mistakes is Important**\n\nEvery programmer at every skill level gets errors in their code. Making mistakes is how we all learn to program. Programming is a little like solving a puzzle where the goal is to get the desired outcome through a series of attempts. You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. An error message will not break your computer. Remember, you can always reload a notebook if it stops working properly or you misplace an important piece of code. Under the edit menu, there is an option to undo changes. (Alternatively, you can use **command z** on Mac and **control z** on Windows.) To learn any skill, you need to be willing to play and experiment. Programming is no different.\n\n## Expressions and Operators\n\nThe simplest form of Python programming is an [expression](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) using an [operator](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator). An [expression](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) is a simple mathematical statement like:\n\n> 1 + 1\n\nThe [operator](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator) in this case is `+`, sometimes called \"plus\" or \"addition\". Try this operation in the code box below. Remember to click the \"Run\" button or press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or shift + return (OS X) on your keyboard to run the code."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Type the expression in this code block.

Parentheses\n2. Exponents\n3. Multiplication and Division (from left to right)\n4. Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)\n\n[Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) can evaluate parentheses and exponents, as well as a number of additional [operators](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator) you may not have learned in grade school.

In the above examples, our [expressions](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#expression) evaluated to single numerical value. Numerical values come in two basic forms:\n\n* [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer)\n* [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float) (or floating-point number)\n\nAn [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer), what we sometimes call a \"whole number\", is a number without a decimal point that can be positive or negative. When a value uses a decimal, it is called a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float) or floating-point number. Two numbers that are mathematically equivalent could be in two different data types. For example, mathematically 5 is equal to 5.0, yet the former is an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) while the latter is a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float).\n\nOf course, [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) can also help us manipulate text. A snippet of text in Python is called a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string). A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can be written with single or double quotes. A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can use letters, spaces, line breaks, and numbers. So 5 is an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer), 5.0 is a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float), but '5' and '5.0' are [strings](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string). A [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) can also be blank, such as ''.\n\n|Familiar Name | Programming name | Examples |\n|---|---|---|\n|Whole number|integer| -3, 0, 2, 534|\n|Decimal|float | 6.3, -19.23, 5.0, 0.01|\n|Text|string| 'Hello world', '1700 butterflies', '', '1823'|\n\nThe distinction between each of these data types may seem unimportant, but [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) treats each one differently. For example, we can ask [Python](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#python) whether an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) is equal to a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float), but we cannot ask whether a [string](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#string) is equal to an [integer](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) or a [float](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float).\n\nTo evaluate whether two values are equal, we can use two equals signs between them. The expression will evaluate to either `True` or `False`."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Run this code cell to determine whether the values are equal\n42 == 42.0","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Run this code cell to compare an integer with a string\n15 == 'fifteen'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Run this code cell to compare an integer with a string\n15 == '15'","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"When we use the addition [operator](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#operator) on [integers](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#integer) or [floats](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#float), they are added to create a sum.
